        <p>I am a Senior Computer Science Student at Michigan State University. During my time at MSU, I've gained an exceptional interest
          in Web Development and design. Currently, I am working as an intern for a local Website Development firm where I have gotten 
          the chance to design, develop, and deploy websites for municipalities and local businesses. I am working along side
          graphic designers, and other developers to create ADA compliant user-friendly interfaces to improve the accessability for lots of people!
          <br><br>
          In my free time I enjoy mountain biking at parks around Michigan, Rock Climbing, and Cooking.
